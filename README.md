The ipumsr package helps import IPUMS extracts from the [IPUMS
website](https://www.ipums.org) into R. IPUMS provides census and survey
data from around the world integrated across time and space. IPUMS
integration and documentation makes it easy to study change, conduct
comparative research, merge information across data types, and analyze
individuals within family and community context. Data and services are
available free of charge.

The ipumsr package can be installed by running the following command:

``` r
install.packages("ipumsr")
```

Or, you can install the development version using the following
commands:

``` r
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("ipums/ipumsr")
```

## Learning More

The vignettes are a great place to learn more about ipumsr and IPUMS
data:

-   [See the **ipums** vignette for a general
    introduction](https://tech.popdata.org/ipumsr/articles/ipums.html)

-   For a more detailed look at some of the features, see these
    vignettes:

You can access them from R with the `vignette()` command (eg
`vignette("value-labels")`).

If you are installing from github and want the vignettes, youâ€™ll need to
run the following commands first:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ipums/ipumsr/ipumsexamples")
devtools::install_github("ipums/ipumsr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
