Browsing data on the IPUMS website can be a little like grocery shopping when
you're hungry â€” you show up to grab a couple things, but everything looks so
good, and you end up with an overflowing cart[^1]. When you do this with IPUMS
data, unfortunately, sometimes your extract may get so large that it doesn't fit
in your computer's memory. 

If this you've got an extract that's too big, both the IPUMS website
and the ipumsr package have tools to help. There are four basic strategies:

1. Get more memory.
2. Reduce the size of your dataset.
3. Use "chunked" reading.
4. Use a database.

The IPUMS website has features to help with option 2, and the ipumsr package can 
help you with options 3 and 4 (option 1 depends on your wallet).

The examples in this vignette will rely on the ipumsr, dplyr and biglm
packages, and the example CPS extract used in the `ipums-cps` vignette.
If you want to follow along, you should follow the instructions in that vignette
to make an extract.
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(ipumsr)
library(dplyr)

# To run the full vignette you'll also need the following packages:
installed_biglm <- requireNamespace("biglm")
installed_db_pkgs <- requireNamespace("DBI") & 
  requireNamespace("RSQLite") & 
  requireNamespace("dbplyr")

# Change these filepaths to the filepaths of your downloaded extract
cps_ddi_file <- "cps_00001.xml"
cps_data_file <- "cps_00001.dat"
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# If files doesn't exist, check if ipumsexamples is installed
if (!file.exists(cps_ddi_file) | !file.exists(cps_data_file)) {
  ipumsexamples_ddi <- system.file("extdata", "cps_00011.xml", package = "ipumsexamples")
  ipumsexamples_data <- system.file("extdata", "cps_00011.dat.gz", package = "ipumsexamples")
  if (file.exists(ipumsexamples_ddi)) cps_ddi_file <- ipumsexamples_ddi
  if (file.exists(ipumsexamples_data)) cps_data_file <- ipumsexamples_data
}

# But if they still don't exist, give an error message
if (!file.exists(cps_ddi_file) | !file.exists(cps_data_file)) {
  message(paste0(
    "Could not find CPS data and so could not run vignette.\n\n",
    "If you tried to download the data following the instructions above, please make" , 
    "sure that the filenames are correct: ", 
    "\nddi - ", cps_ddi_file, "\ndata - ", cps_data_file, "\nAnd that you are in ",
    "the correct directory if you are using a relative path:\nCurrent directory - ", 
    getwd(), "\n\n",
    "The data is also available on github. You can install it using the following ",
    "commands: \n",
    "  if (!require(devtools)) install.packages('devtools')\n",
    "  devtools::install_github('mnpopcenter/ipumsr/ipumsexamples')\n",
    "After installation, the data should be available for this vignette.\n\n"
  ))
  
  installed_biglm <- FALSE
  installed_db_pkgs <- FALSE
  
  knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
}
```

# Option 1: Trade money for convenience 
If you've got a dataset that's too big for your RAM, you could always get more.
You could accomplish this by upgrading your current computer, getting a new
one, or paying a cloud service like Amazon or Microsoft Azure (or one of the
many other similar services). Here are guides for using R on
[Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/statistical-analysis-with-open-source-r-and-rstudio-on-amazon-emr/)
and 
[Microsoft Azure](https://blog.jumpingrivers.com/posts/2017/rstudio_azure_cloud_1/).

# Option 2: Do you really need all of that?
The IPUMS website has many features that will let you reduce the size of your
extract. The easiest thing to do is to review your sample and variable
selections to see if you can drop some. 

If you do need every sample and variable, but your analysis is on a specific
subset of the data, the IPUMS extract engine has a feature called "Select
Cases", where you can subset on an included variable (for example you could
subset on AGE so that your extract only includes those older than 65, or subset
on EDUCATION to look at only college graduates). In most IPUMS microdata
projects, the select cases feature is on the "Create Extract" page, as the last
step before you submit the extract. If you've already submitted the extract, you
can click the "revise" link on the "Download or Revise Extracts" page to access
the "Select Cases" feature.

Or, if you would be happy with a random subsample of the data, the IPUMS extract
engine has an option to "Customize Sample Size" that will take a random sample.
This feature is also available on the "Create Extract" page, as the last step
before you submit the extract. Again, if you've already submitted your extract,
you can access this feature by clicking the "revise" link on the "Download or
Revise Extracts" page.


# Option 3: Work one chunk at a time
ipumsr has "chunked" versions of the microdata reading functions
 (`read_ipums_micro_chunked()` and `read_ipums_micro_list_chunked()`). 
These chunked versions of the functions allow you to specify a function that
will be applied to each chunk, and then also control how the results from these
chunks are combined. This functionality is based on the chunked functionality
introduced by `readr` and so is quite flexible. Below, we'll outline solutions
to three common use-cases for IPUMS data: tabulation, regression and selecting
cases.

## Chunked tabulation example 
Let's say you want to find the percent of people in the workforce by
their self-reported health. Since this extract is small enough to fit
in memory, we could just do the following:
```{r}
read_ipums_micro(
  cps_ddi_file, data_file = cps_data_file, verbose = FALSE
) %>%
  mutate(
    HEALTH = as_factor(HEALTH),
    AT_WORK = EMPSTAT %>% 
      lbl_relabel(
        lbl(1, "Yes") ~ .lbl == "At work", 
        lbl(0, "No") ~ .lbl != "At work"
      ) %>% 
      as_factor()
  ) %>%
  group_by(HEALTH, AT_WORK) %>%
  summarize(n = n())
```

But let's pretend like we can only store 1,000 rows at a time.
In this case, we need to use a chunked function, tabulate for
each chunk, and then calculate the counts across all of the
chunks. 

First we'll make the callback function, which will take two arguments: 
x (the data from a chunk) and pos (the position of the chunk, expressed as 
the line in the input file at which the chunk starts). We'll only use x, but 
the callback function must always take both these arguments.

```{r}
cb_function <- function(x, pos) {
  x %>% mutate(
    HEALTH = as_factor(HEALTH),
    AT_WORK = EMPSTAT %>% 
      lbl_relabel(
        lbl(1, "Yes") ~ .lbl == "At work", 
        lbl(0, "No") ~ .lbl != "At work"
      ) %>% 
      as_factor()
  ) %>%
    group_by(HEALTH, AT_WORK) %>%
    summarize(n = n())
}
```

Next we need to create a callback object. The choice of a callback object
depends mainly on how we want to combine the results from applying our callback
function to each chunk. In this case, we want to row-bind the data.frames
returned by `cb_function()`. If we didn't care about attaching IPUMS value
labels and other metadata, we could use `readr::DataFrameCallback`, but ipumsr
includes the `IpumsDataFrameCallback` object that allows you to preserve this
metadata. 

Callback objects are [R6]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R6) 
objects, but you don't need to be familiar with R6 to use them[^2]. For now, all
we really need to know is that to create a callback we can use, we use `$new()`
syntax.

```{r}
cb <- IpumsDataFrameCallback$new(cb_function)
```

Next we read in the data with the `read_ipums_micro_chunked()` function,
specifying the callback and that we want the `chunk_size` to be 1000.
```{r}
chunked_tabulations <- read_ipums_micro_chunked(
  cps_ddi_file, data_file = cps_data_file, verbose = FALSE,
  callback = cb, chunk_size = 1000
)
```

Now we have a data.frame with the counts by health and work status within each
chunk. To get the full table, we just need to sum by health and work status one
more time.

```{r}
chunked_tabulations %>%
  group_by(HEALTH, AT_WORK) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(n))
```

## Chunked regression example
With the biglm package, it is possible to use R to perform a regression 
on data that is too large to store in memory all at once. The ipumsr
package provides a callback designed to make this simple: `IpumsBiglmCallback`.

Again we'll use the CPS example, which is small enough that we can keep it in
memory. Here's an example of a regression looking at how hours worked,
self-reported health and age are related among those who are currently working.
This is meant as a simple example, and ignores many of the complexities in this
relationship, so please use caution when interpreting.

```{r}
# Read in data
data <- read_ipums_micro(
  cps_ddi_file, data_file = cps_data_file, verbose = FALSE
)

# Prepare data for model
# (age has been capped at 99, which we assume is high enough to not
#  cause any problems so we leave it.)
data <- data %>%
   mutate(
      HEALTH = as_factor(HEALTH),
      AHRSWORKT = lbl_na_if(AHRSWORKT, ~.lbl == "NIU (Not in universe)"),
      AT_WORK = EMPSTAT %>% 
        lbl_relabel(
          lbl(1, "Yes") ~ .lbl == "At work", 
          lbl(0, "No") ~ .lbl != "At work"
        ) %>% 
        as_factor()
    ) %>%
    filter(AT_WORK == "Yes")

# Run regression
model <- lm(AHRSWORKT ~ AGE + I(AGE^2) + HEALTH, data)
summary(model)
```

To do the same regression, but with only 1000 rows loaded at a time, we work in
a similar manner.

First we make the `IpumsBiglmCallback` callback object that specifies both the 
model and a function to prepare the data.
```{r, eval = installed_biglm}
biglm_cb <- IpumsBiglmCallback$new(
  model = AHRSWORKT ~ AGE + I(AGE^2) + HEALTH,
  prep = function(x, pos) {
    x %>% 
      mutate(
        HEALTH = as_factor(HEALTH),
        AHRSWORKT = lbl_na_if(AHRSWORKT, ~.lbl == "NIU (Not in universe)"),
        AT_WORK = EMPSTAT %>% 
          lbl_relabel(
            lbl(1, "Yes") ~ .lbl == "At work", 
            lbl(0, "No") ~ .lbl != "At work"
          ) %>% 
          as_factor()
      ) %>%
      filter(AT_WORK == "Yes")
  }
)
```
And then we read the data using `read_ipums_micro_chunked()`, passing the
callback that we just made.
```{r, eval = installed_biglm}
chunked_model <- read_ipums_micro_chunked(
  cps_ddi_file, data_file = cps_data_file, verbose = FALSE,
  callback = biglm_cb, chunk_size = 1000
)

summary(chunked_model)
```

## Chunked "select cases" example
Sometimes you may want to select a subset of the data before reading it in. The
IPUMS website has this functionality built in, which can be a faster way to do
this (this "select cases" functionality is described in the second section
above). Also, Unix commands like `awk` and `sed` will generally be much faster
than these R based solutions. However, it is possible to use the chunked functions 
to create a subset, which can be convenient if you want to subset on some complex
logic that would be hard to code into the IPUMS extract system or Unix tools.

```{r}
# Subset only those in "Poor" health
chunked_subset <- read_ipums_micro_chunked(
  cps_ddi_file, data_file = cps_data_file, verbose = FALSE,
  callback = IpumsDataFrameCallback$new(function(x, pos) {
    filter(x, HEALTH == 5)
  }), 
  chunk_size = 1000
)
```

# Option 4: Use a database
Databases are another option for data that cannot fit in memory as an R
data.frame. If you have access to a database on a remote machine, then
you can easily pull in parts of the data for your analysis. Even if you'll
need to store the database on your machine, it may have more efficient
storage of data so your data fits in your memory, or it may use your
hard drive.

R's tools for integrating with databases are improving quickly. The DBI 
package has been updated, dplyr (through dbplyr) provides a
frontend that allows you to write the same code for data in a database as you
would for a local data.frame, and packages like sparklyr, sparkR, bigrquery and
others provide access to the latest and greatest.

There are many different kinds of databases, each with their own benefits, 
weaknesses and tradeoffs. As such, it's hard to give concrete advice without
knowing your specific use-case. However, once you've chosen a database, in
general, there will be two steps: Importing the data into the database and then
connecting it to R. 

As an example, we'll use the RSQLite package to load the data into an in-memory 
database. RSQLite is great because it is easy to set up, but it is probably
not efficient enough to help you if you need to use a database because your
data doesn't fit in memory.

## Importing data into a database
When using rectangular extracts, your best bet to import IPUMS data into
your database is probably going to be a csv file. Most databases support
csv importing, and these implementations will generally be well supported
since this is a common file format.

However, if you need a hierarchical extract, or your database software
doesn't support the csv format, then you can use the chunking functions 
to load the data into a database without storing the full data in R.

```{r, eval = installed_db_pkgs}
# Connect to database
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)
con <- dbConnect(SQLite(), path = ":memory:")

# Add data to tables in chunks
ddi <- read_ipums_ddi(cps_ddi_file)
read_ipums_micro_chunked(
  ddi,
  data_file = cps_data_file,
  readr::SideEffectChunkCallback$new(function(x, pos) {
    if (pos == 1) {
      dbWriteTable(con, "cps", x)
    } else {
      dbWriteTable(con, "cps", x, row.names = FALSE, append = TRUE)
    }
  }),
  chunk_size = 1000,
  verbose = FALSE
)

```

## Connecting to a database with dbplyr
The dbplyr vignette "dbplyr" (which you can access with 
`vignette("dbplyr", package = "dbplyr")`) is a good place to get started
learning about how to connect to a database. Here I'll just briefly show
some examples.

```{r, eval = installed_db_pkgs}
example <- tbl(con, "cps")

example %>%
  filter('AGE' > 25)
```

Though dbplyr shows us a nice preview of the first rows of the result of our
query, the data still lives in the database. When using a regular database,
in general you'd use the function `dplyr::collect()` to load in the full
results of the query to your R session. However, the database has no
concept of IPUMS attributes like value and variable labels, so if you 
want them, you can use `ipums_collect()` like so:

```{r, eval = installed_db_pkgs}
example %>%
  filter('AGE' > 25) %>%
  ipums_collect(ddi)
```
